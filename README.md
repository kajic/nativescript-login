## Usage

### Facebook Login
#### Android integration

* Follow the `1. Select an App or Create a New App` step in the [manual](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android)
* Edit/create your `App_Resources/Android/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file and add the following, replace the `{{app-id}}` and `{{app-name}}` values:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <!-- If your strings.xml already existed, add the following <string> elements -->
    <string name="app_name">{{app-name}}</string>
    <string name="title_activity_kimera">{{app-name}}</string>
    <string name="facebook_app_id">{{app-id}}</string>
    <string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">fb{{app-id}}</string>
</resources>
```

* Edit your `App_Resources/Android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` element.
```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" 
        android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
```

* Follow the `6. Provide the Development and Release Key Hashes for Your App` step in the [manual](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios)
* Logging in with your Facebook account should now work! The SDK takes care of the rest.

#### iOS integration

* Follow the `1. Select an App or Create a New App` step in the [manual](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android)
* Enter your Bundle Identifier at the step `3. Register and Configure Your App with Facebook` -> `3a. Add your Bundle Identifier`
** Open `App_Resources/iOS/Info.plist` and add the following, replace `{{APP_ID}}` with your own app ID and `{{APP_NAME}}` with your app name:
 ```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<!-- If you already have a CFBundleURLTypes key, only add the dict section to the array -->
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>

// First create an options object:

// The most basic sign in options.
const signInOptions: GoogleSignInOptions = {
    SignInType: GoogleSignInType.Local,
    RequestEmail: true

   console.log("Error while singing in to Google: ", e);
});
```

### Sign In with Apple

- Go to [the Apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) and create a new app identifier with the "Sign In with Apple" Capability enabled. Make sure you sign your app with a provisioning profile using that app identifier.
- Open your app's `App_Resources/iOS` folder and [add this](https://github.com/klippa-app/nativescript-login/blob/master/demo/app/App_Resources/iOS/app.entitlements) (or append) to a file named `app.entitlements`.

#### Android integration (and iOS < 13)

**Sadly, Sign In with Apple does not support Android, due to the way they made the JS version, it's also not possible to create a version in a webview. You will always need a backend to handle it. I will write a how-to on this later.**

#### iOS integration (iOS >= 13)

To start the login:

```typescript
import { SignInWithAppleOptions, startSignInWithApple, SignInWithAppleScope, signInWithAppleAvailable } from "@klippa/nativescript-login";
import * as dialogs from "tns-core-modules/ui/dialogs";

if (signInWithAppleAvailable()) {
    // First create an options object:
    const signInOptions: SignInWithAppleOptions = {
        Scopes: [SignInWithAppleScope.EMAIL, SignInWithAppleScope.FULLNAME]
    };

    // Please note that result can also be a failure result.
    // The actual result is in the object.
    startSignInWithApple(signInOptions).then((result) => {
        console.log("Sign In with Apple result: ", result);
    }).catch((e) => {
       console.log("Error while using Sign In with Apple: ", e);
    });
} else {
    dialogs.alert("Sign In with Apple is not available for your device");
}
```

To get the current state:

```typescript
import { getSignInWithAppleState, signInWithAppleAvailable } from "@klippa/nativescript-login";
import * as dialogs from "tns-core-modules/ui/dialogs";

if (signInWithAppleAvailable()) {
    // User ID must be the ID that was previously received from the sign in.
    const userID = "";

    // Please note that result can also be a failure result.
    // The actual result is in the object.
    getSignInWithAppleState(userID).then((result) => {
        console.log("Sign in with Apple State result: ", result);
    }).catch((e) => {
       console.log("Error getting Sign in with Apple State: ", e);
    });
} else {
    dialogs.alert("Sign In with Apple is not available for your device");
}
```

## Other types of authentication

To keep the scope of this project simple and clean, and to keep the dependencies small, we only support login providers that have native SDK's.
If you want to support other ways of logging in, please check out these projects:

* [nativescript-oauth2](https://github.com/alexziskind1/nativescript-oauth2)
* [nativescript-inappbrowser](https://github.com/proyecto26/nativescript-inappbrowser)

## API

### Google

**GoogleSignInOptions**:

| Property | Description |
| ---  | ---   |
| SignInType | The type of sign in. `GoogleSignInType.LOCAL` is to use the information on the device, `GoogleSignInType.ServerAuthCode` for if you want to retrieve user information serverside.  |
| ServerClientId | The Client ID of the server you are requesting a `ServerAuthCode` or `IdToken`. For when using login type is `ServerAuthCode`, or when `RequestIdToken is true`.  |
| ForceCodeForRefreshToken | Used when type is ServerAuthCode. If true, the granted code can be exchanged for an access token and a refresh token. The first time you retrieve a code, a refresh_token will be granted automatically. Subsequent requests will require additional user consent. Use false by default; only use true if your server has suffered some failure and lost the user's refresh token. Only has effect on Android.  |
| HostedDomain | Specifies a hosted domain restriction. By setting this, sign in will be restricted to accounts of the user in the specified domain. Domain of the user to restrict (for example, "mycollege.edu"),  |
| AccountName | Specifies an account name on the device that should be used. If this is never called, the client will use the current default account for this application. The account name on the device that should be used to sign in. Only has effect on Android.  |
| RequestIdToken | Specifies that an ID token for authenticated users is requested. Requesting an ID token requires that the server client ID be specified. iOS always return the user ID Token.  |
| RequestId | Specifies that user ID is requested by your application. For iOS you can't control this, ID is always returned.  |
| RequestEmail | Specifies that email info is requested by your application. Note that we don't recommend keying user by email address since email address might change. Keying user by ID is the preferable approach. For iOS you can't control this, use RequestProfile if you want the email.  |
| RequestProfile | Specifies that user's profile info is requested by your application. Default: true. On iOS you have to either set RequestProfile or give custom scopes.  |
| ExtraScopes | A list of `GoogleSignInScope` values to specify OAuth 2.0 scopes for your application requests. Normally you will not need this.  |
| ForceAccountSelection | Whether you want to force account selection. If you enable this option we will logout the user for you in the app.  |

**GoogleSignInResult**:

| Property | Description |
| ---  | ---   |
| ResultType | The result, either `GoogleSignInResultType.FAILED` or `GoogleSignInResultType.SUCCESS`.  |
| ErrorCode | When result type is `GoogleSignInResultType.FAILED`, the error code of the request.  |
| ErrorMessage | When result type is `GoogleSignInResultType.FAILED`, the error message of the request.  |
| GrantedScopes | A list of granted scopes.  |
| RequestedScopes | A list of requested scopes. This is only filled in by the Android SDK. |
| GivenName | -  |
| Id | The ID of the user |
| IdToken | The ID token (JWT) to send to your backend  |
| DisplayName | - |
| FamilyName |  - |
| PhotoUrl | - |
| Email | - |
| ServerAuthCode | The Server Auth Code that your backend can use to retrieve user information.  |

| ProfileDataFields | The fields to fetch when requesting the profile data. When not set, we get the following fields: id,name,first_name,last_name,picture.type(large),email. Some fields might return an object, like the picture field.  |
| ForceAccountSelection | Whether you want to force account selection. If you enable this option we will logout the user for you in the app.  |

**FacebookLoginResult**:

| Property | Description |
| ---  | ---   |
| ResultType | The result, either `FacebookLoginResultType.FAILED`, `FacebookLoginResultType.CANCELED` `FacebookLoginResultType.SUCCESS`.  |
